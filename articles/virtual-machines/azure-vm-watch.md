# VM watch: Enhancing VM health monitoring (preview)

VM watch is a standardized, lightweight, and adaptable service offering for virtual machines (VMs) and virtual machine scale sets. It runs health checks within a VM at configurable intervals and sends the results via a uniform data model to Azure. The AI operations (AIOps) engines for production monitoring in Azure consume these health results for regression detection and prevention.

VM watch is delivered via the [Application Health VM extension](/azure/virtual-machines/extensions/health-extension?tabs=rest-api) to provide ease of deployment and manageability for customers. In addition, VM watch is offered at no extra cost.

## Monitoring specifics for VM watch

- **Ease of adoption**: VM watch is available through the [Application Health VM extension](/azure/virtual-machines/extensions/health-extension?tabs=rest-api).
- **Flexible deployment**: You can enable VM watch by using an Azure Resource Manager template (ARM template), PowerShell, or the Azure CLI.
- **Compatibility**: VM watch operates seamlessly in both Linux and Windows environments. It's suitable for individual VMs and virtual machine scale sets alike.
- **Resource governance**: VM watch provides efficient monitoring without affecting system performance. Resource caps on the CPU and memory utilization of the VM watch process help protect VMs.
- **Out-of-the-box readiness**: VM watch comes equipped with a suite of default tests that you can configure for your scenarios.

### Network

| **DNS Resolution** | Check | Verify if one or more DNS names can be resolved. |
| **TCPSynRetransmits (Linux Only)** | Metric | The number of times the system retransmits a TCP SYN and SYN/ACK packet before giving up on establishing a connection.|
| **SegmentsRetransmitted** | Metric | The number of transmitted TCP segments that contain one or more previously transmitted octets. |
| **NormalizedSegmentsRetransmitted** | Metric | **SegmentsRetransmitted** / (**SegmentsSent** + **SegmentsRetransmitted**) |
| **ConnectionResets** | Metric | The number of times that TCP connections made a direct transition to the `CLOSED` state from either the `ESTABLISHED` state or the `CLOSE_WAIT` state. |
| **NormalizedConnectionResets** | Metric | The percentage of connections that were reset during the last measurement interval. |
| **FailedConnectionAttempts** | Metric |The number of times that TCP connections made a direct transition to the `CLOSED` state from either the `SYN_SENT` state or the `SYN_RCVD` state. |
| **NormalizedFailedConnectionAttempts** | Metric | **FailedConnectionAttempts** / (**ActiveConnectionOpenings** + **PassiveConnectionOpenings**) |
| **ActiveConnectionOpenings** | Metric | The number of times that TCP connections made a direct transition to the `SYN_SENT` state from the `CLOSED` state. |
| **PassiveConnectionOpenings** | Metric | The number of times that TCP connections made a direct transition to the `SYN_RCVD` state from the `LISTEN` state. |
| **CurrentConnections** | Metric | The number of connections established. |
| **SegmentsReceived** | Metric | The number of segments received, including segments received in error. |
| **SegmentsSent** | Metric | The number of segments sent, including segments on current connections but excluding segments that contain only retransmitted octets. |


### Disk

| **Signal name** | **Type** | **Description** |
|:---:|:---:|:---:|
| **Azure Disk I/O** | Check | Verify file creation, write, and read. Delete operations on each drive mounted to the VM. |
| **FreeSpaceInBytes** | Metric | The free disk space of the target mount point. |
| **UsedSpaceInBytes** | Metric | The used disk space of the target mount point. |
| **CapacityInBytes**  | Metric | The disk space capacity of the target mount point. |
| **UsedPercent**      | Metric | The percentage of used disk space for the target mount point. |
| **WriteOps**         | Metric | The write operations per second for the target disk/partition. |
| **ReadOps**          | Metric | The read operations per second for the target disk/partition. |

### CPU

| **Signal name** | **Type** | **Description** |
|:---:|:---:|:---:|
| **ProcessCPUCoreUsage** | Metric | An instantaneous measurement of the percentage of a single CPU core that the target process is using (100 = 100%, a whole core). |
| **ProcessCPUMachineUsage** | Metric | The percentage of the machine's total CPU that this process is using. |
| **MachineTotalCpuUsage** | Metric | The VM's total instantaneous CPU utilization. |

### Memory

| **Signal name** | **Type** | **Description** |
|:---:|:---:|:---:|
| **ProcessRSSPercent** | Metric | **Process RSS** / (**Machine Total Memory** * **100%**) |
| **ProcessPageFaults** | Metric | The number of page faults since the process started. |
| **MachineMemoryTotalInBytes** | Metric | The VM's total Memory in Bytes. |
| **MachineMemoryUsedPercent** | Metric | **Machine Used Memory** / (**Machine Total Memory** * **100%**) |
| **TotalPageFaults** | Metric | The total number of page faults for all running processes since they started. |

### Process

| **Signal name** | **Type** | **Description** |
|:---:|:---:|:---:|
| **Process Creation** | Check | Start a lightweight process to validate that process creation is possible. |
| **Running Process(es)** | Check | Verify if the target process or processes are running. |
| **UpTime** | Metric | How long the target process has been up and running since the last process startup. |

### IMDS

| **Signal name** | **Type** | **Description** |
|:---:|:---:|:---:|
| **IMDS** | Check | Verify that the user can reach an Azure Instance Metadata Service (IMDS) endpoint from within the VM. VM information is returned from the IMDS endpoint query. |

### Clock

| **Signal name** | **Type** | **Description** |
|:---:|:---:|:---:|
| **Clock Skew** | Check | Verify the clock skew between the remote Network Time Protocol (NTP) server and the Azure VM. For a Windows VM, fall back to check if the Windows Time service is synced with `w32tm` if the remote NTP server is inaccessible. |

### OS

| **Signal name** | **Type** | **Description** |
|:---:|:---:|:---:|
| **System Errors** | Metric | Collect the number of errors from the system-level event log (Windows only) where the SystemData <=2 (including LOG_ALWAYS, Critical, Error).
